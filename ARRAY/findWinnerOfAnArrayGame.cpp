// Given an integer array arr of distinct integers and an integer k.

// A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. arr[0] and arr[1]). In each round of the game, we compare arr[0] with arr[1], the larger integer wins and remains at position 0, and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins k consecutive rounds.

// Return the integer which will win the game.

// It is guaranteed that there will be a winner of the game.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: arr = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7], k = 2
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Let's see the rounds of the game:
// Round |       arr       | winner | win_count
//   1   | [2,1,3,5,4,6,7] | 2      | 1
//   2   | [2,3,5,4,6,7,1] | 3      | 1
//   3   | [3,5,4,6,7,1,2] | 5      | 1
//   4   | [5,4,6,7,1,2,3] | 5      | 2
// So we can see that 4 rounds will be played and 5 is the winner because it wins 2 consecutive games.
// Example 2:

// Input: arr = [3,2,1], k = 10
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 3 will win the first 10 rounds consecutively.
