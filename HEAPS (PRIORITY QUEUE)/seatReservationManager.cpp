// Design a system that manages the reservation state of n seats that are numbered from 1 to n.

// Implement the SeatManager class:

// SeatManager(int n) Initializes a SeatManager object that will manage n seats numbered from 1 to n. All seats are initially available.
// int reserve() Fetches the smallest-numbered unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.
// void unreserve(int seatNumber) Unreserves the seat with the given seatNumber.
 

// Example 1:

// Input
// ["SeatManager", "reserve", "reserve", "unreserve", "reserve", "reserve", "reserve", "reserve", "unreserve"]
// [[5], [], [], [2], [], [], [], [], [5]]
// Output
// [null, 1, 2, null, 2, 3, 4, 5, null]

// Explanation
// SeatManager seatManager = new SeatManager(5); // Initializes a SeatManager with 5 seats.
// seatManager.reserve();    // All seats are available, so return the lowest numbered seat, which is 1.
// seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.
// seatManager.unreserve(2); // Unreserve seat 2, so now the available seats are [2,3,4,5].
// seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.
// seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 3.
// seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 4.
// seatManager.reserve();    // The only available seat is seat 5, so return 5.
// seatManager.unreserve(5); // Unreserve seat 5, so now the available seats are [5].
